# My process

0.  Measuring the sample jpg layout file and defining the main sizes (blocks, font-sizes, paddings, margins)
1. Creating html code
2. Creating css, making "boxes" (divs)
3. Colorizing it
4. Making the main elements: margin, padding
5. Creating the text, styling it
6. Fine tuning: letter-spacing, line-height properties
7. Finalizing the code: removing the unnecesarry comments, adding new ones, reorder the properties by alphabetic
8. Finishing this md. file

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my very first project. I started learning via Udemy, where the are so many different small projects involved in the course.

I understood the basics of the different boxes and layouts and practiced it. There were two different solution:

1. Normal box
I startd with a nomral box. Here I used to floowings to center the main element:

```css
/* option-2: using a box according to the normal flow   
margin: 0 auto;                                
top: 50%;
transform: translate(0, -50%);
position: relative;
*/
```

2. The Flexbox
I changed to flexbox, because the code looks more clearer in this case.


### Useful resources

(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the usage of flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
